# Progress Log

## Session: 2026-11-07

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery

- **Status:** complete
- **Started:** 2026-11-07T15:51Z
- Actions taken:
  - Recovered the full OhMyFreeAI v3.3 architecture commitments from project conversation context.
  - Read Planning with Files SKILL.md; fetched version 3.28.1 source.
  - Confirmed repository README is only `# OhMyFreeAI`.
  - Created branch `foundation/bootstrap` from `main`.
  - Attempted local git clone; failed because the container could not resolve github.com. Switched to GitHub connector for repository operations.
  - Created task planning files using the upstream template structure as the documented fallback because the initializer cannot be executed in the shell environment.
  - Inspected both supplied Wails prototypes: Go 1.24, Wails v2.10.2, embedded frontend; the remote-complete archive includes remote Colab polling and local monitoring. Did not adopt the rejected visual design.
  - Parsed all three uploaded Python scripts with ast.parse successfully; did not execute any script because they modify or interact with the user's live runtime.
  - Read the user's Material Design 3 skill and key references; confirmed web-specific limitations (Material Web maintenance mode, no M3 Expressive parity).
  - Read KotlinComposeKit's reusable component design skill; extracted only transferable component API principles, not Kotlin/Compose implementation details.
  - Vendored Planning with Files v3.28.1, Material 3 v1.1.1, and the KotlinComposeKit compose-component-design skill plus their source references/licenses into .agents/skills/ on the project branch. These copies are project-scoped; they do not install user-wide host hooks in this ChatGPT runtime.
  - Confirmed local toolchain: Go 1.23.2, Node 22.16.0, npm 10.9.2, Python 3.13.5. Wails v3's official docs require Go 1.26+, so this container cannot certify a Wails v3 build.
- Files created/modified:
  - .planning/2026-11-07-ohmyfreeai-foundation/task_plan.md
  - .planning/2026-11-07-ohmyfreeai-foundation/findings.md
  - .planning/2026-11-07-ohmyfreeai-foundation/progress.md

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure

- **Status:** in_progress
- Actions taken:
  - Began establishing project-scoped skills and core architecture documentation.
  - Recorded the Colab Free policy restrictions as a feasibility gate; no prohibited remote-control or service-tunnel workaround will be implemented.

## Test Results

| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Repository starting state | README.md | Inspect default branch entry point | README contains only `# OhMyFreeAI` | PASS |
| GitHub code search | go.mod, package.json, .gitignore, PROJECT_SPEC.md | Detect existing project files | No results returned for searched paths | PARTIAL |
| Local git clone | HTTPS GitHub URL | Checkout repository and skill source | DNS resolution failed | BLOCKED |
| Planning skill source | GitHub fetch_file | Read authoritative SKILL.md | Fetched v3.28.1 | PASS |
| Planning initializer | Local execution | Initialize plan using upstream helper | Cannot run: upstream files not mounted and network unavailable | BLOCKED |

## Error Log

| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| 2026-11-07T15:52Z | Could not resolve github.com during git clone | 1 | Use GitHub connector; do not retry same clone |

## 5-Question Reboot Check

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 1 - Requirements & Discovery |
| Where am I going? | Phase 2 - Planning & Structure, then implementation and verification |
| What's the goal? | Establish a verified foundation for OhMyFreeAI without violating free-only constraints |
| What have I learned? | See findings.md |
| What have I done? | Branch created, repository inspected, planning artifacts established |
