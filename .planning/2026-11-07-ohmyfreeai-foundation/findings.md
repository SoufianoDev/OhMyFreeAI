# Findings & Decisions

## Requirements

- Build OhMyFreeAI as a free-first desktop application; do not propose paid services or alternate paid hosting.
- Go core; Wails remains a candidate subject to proof-of-concept on Linux and Windows.
- Web UI uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript ES Modules and Material Design 3; calm, professional, accessible, bilingual Arabic/English, RTL/LTR.
- SQLite persistence; modular monolith with Clean Architecture and explicit ports/adapters.
- Google Colab Free is the primary remote runtime; llama.cpp is the primary inference engine; OpenCode is the first client.
- Local OpenAI-compatible Gateway defaults to 127.0.0.1:18081; upstream llama-server previously used 8081.
- Google Drive is persistent artifact storage only; stage files to Colab local disk and verify before execution.
- Model compatibility must include architecture/checkpoint/conversion/format/features/backend/runtime and actual inference verification.
- Colab compatibility must include actual GPU/VRAM, RAM, CUDA/driver, disk, quantization, context/KV cache, Flash Attention, GPU layers and overhead.
- UI must distinguish supported, unsupported, and unverified models and explain minimum resources.
- Backup artifact name/extension: omfaibackup; backups contain app config and recoverable metadata/references, not large model/engine artifacts, secrets, or live processes.
- Preserve prior successful Colab Free + llama.cpp + Gateway + OpenCode path until audited.
- Do not claim runtime or model support based on static file presence or compilation alone.

## Research Findings

- Target repository `SoufianoDev/OhMyFreeAI` default branch is `main`.
- The repository's current README.md contains only the Markdown heading `# OhMyFreeAI`.
- GitHub code searches for `task_plan.md`, `.gitignore`, `go.mod`, `package.json`, and `PROJECT_SPEC.md` returned no results. No existing implementation was surfaced by these searches.
- A working branch `foundation/bootstrap` was created from `main`.
- Planning with Files source repository exposes the skill at `skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md`; fetched metadata reports version 3.28.1.
- Planning with Files requires persistent task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md; new plans should be initialized from its script/template and validated with check-complete.sh --validate.
- The skill's installer requires sibling scripts including set-active-plan.sh. The container cannot resolve github.com, so cloning and executing the upstream initializer from a local checkout is currently unavailable.
- The provided prototype archives and scripts are mounted under /mnt/data and remain to be inspected; they are historical inputs, not verified production code.

## Technical Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Repository bootstrap on foundation/bootstrap | Keep work reviewable and avoid direct changes to main |
| Planning artifacts use .planning/2026-11-07-ohmyfreeai-foundation | Isolate this task's durable plan from later tasks |
| Do not force Kotlin Compose into Wails | Use KotlinComposeKit only for transferable design-system guidance |
| Do not mark a model compatible from family name alone | Compatibility is checkpoint and execution-path specific |
| Separate theoretical support from verified support | Avoid misleading model catalog claims |
| Preserve backup legacy import path where safe | Prevent loss of users' older sdevbackup backups |

## Issues Encountered

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Container cannot resolve github.com for git clone | Use GitHub connector for source control operations; document local execution limitation |

## Visual/Browser Findings

- No visual design references have been accepted or applied yet. Inspect the user's Material Design 3 skill before making UI decisions.
